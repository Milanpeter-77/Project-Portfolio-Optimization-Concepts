# **Modern Portfolio Theory – A Theoretical Framework for Portfolio Optimization and Risk Management**

This short study demonstrates the foundational ideas of **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**, showing how diversification, optimization, and risk measurement work in practice.
It begins with the core mathematical principles — expected return, portfolio volatility, and the Sharpe ratio — then builds up to the **efficient frontier**, the **tangency portfolio**, and the **Capital Market Line (CML)** using real market data.
The report also visualizes key **risk metrics** such as **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall (ES)**, comparing empirical and parametric estimates to highlight the limitations of assuming normality in financial returns.

## **Highlights**

* Derivation and explanation of MPT fundamentals (Markowitz 1952)
* Efficient frontier and capital market line visualizations
* Implementation of global minimum variance and tangency portfolios
* Empirical illustration of diversification and risk-return trade-offs
* Practical computation and visualization of **VaR** and **Conditional VaR (ES)**

## **Visual Insights**

* **Efficient Frontier Plot:** shows the transition from single risky assets to optimized portfolios.
* **VaR & ES Plot:** illustrates how tail-risk measures quantify downside exposure.
